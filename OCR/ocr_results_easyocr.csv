Waywardness is a practice of possibility at a
time when all roads, except the ones created
by smashing out, are foreclosed. It obeys no
rules and abides no authorities. It is
unrepentant: It traffics in occult visions of
other worlds and dreams of a different kind
of life. Waywardness is an ongoing
exploration of what might be; it is an
improvisation with the terms of social
existence, when the terms have already been
@BELLADONNAOBSCURA
dictated, when there is little room to
breathe, when you have been sentenced to a
life of servitude, when the house of bondage
looms in whatever direction you move. It is
the untiring practice of trying to live when
were never meant to survive.
