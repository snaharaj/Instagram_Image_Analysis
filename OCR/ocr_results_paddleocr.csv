@kman4545 I just finished dinner...so
I'm feeling too lazy right now to
engage in my favorite hobby of
bulying a member of the church of
ziontology, so I'll just put this out
there: you DO realize israelis are
currently protesting for their right to
r@pe...?
You're aware of that???

streets...protesting for their national
right to r@pe people.... Is THAT the
side of history you really wanna brag
about??

Video footage capturing the 24 minutes before a woman fell to her death from the border
fence sheds light on the reality of an increasingly deadly border region and how
authorities sometimes struggle to respond.
Trigger Warning: This story contains content that may be distressing. It describes a video,
linked to at the end of the story, that depicts a woman's fatal fall from the U.S.-Mexico
border fence, captured in body-worn camera footage.
The young woman's pleas for help became increasingly desperate over the more than 20
minutes she was stuck on top of the U.S.-Mexico border fence in San Diego. As she
screamed for help, Border Patrol agents watched from below and emergency personnel
struggled to reach her.
Twice, a Border Patrol agent turned down suggestions from others to use a nearby ladder to
help the woman, saying they had to wait for the fire department. Another agent led the fire
engine to the wrong location, delaying their arrival.
Finally, she couldn't hold on any longer.
""I'm gonna fall!"" the woman said in Spanish, her cries audible in body-worn camera
footage from a Border Patrol agent at the scene.
Then the footage captured a loud thud. The woman plummeted at least 30 feet to the
ground, hitting her head on a concrete platform at the bottom of the fence before rolling
onto a dirt road.
A Border Patrol agent who had driven up afterward stepped out of his vehicle to get closer.",246,0.9822

women killed by police were unarmed at
the time of their death . Additionally,
